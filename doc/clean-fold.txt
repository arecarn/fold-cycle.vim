DESCRIPTION                                          *clean-fold-description*

Folds in Vim always seemed somewhat cumbersome for taking notes and outlining,
I wanted a clean way of viewing and interfacing with folds. After playing with
emacs org-mode. I knew I wanted visibility cycling in Vim.

USAGE                                                     *clean-fold-usage*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAPPINGS~

                                                *<CR>*
<CR>                    Cycle open folds starting at the top level fold.
                        Subsequent invocations will open folds nested one
                        level under the top level fold. When all folds are
                        open. All folds will be closed recursively.
                        Plug mapping: `<Plug>(fold-open)`

                                                *<BS>*
<BS>                    Cycle close folds starting at the lowest nested fold.
                        Subsequent invocations will close folds nested one
                        level above the lowest nested fold. When all folds are
                        closed the final fold will be opened recursively.
                        Plug mapping: `<Plug>(fold-open)`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOLD TEXT STYLE~

Alternatives to the default foldtext and a new foldmethod

fold#clean_fold_text({foldchar})
                Cleaner alternative to default fold text, still including
                number of folded lines

                Examples: >
                        set foldtext=fold#clean_fold_text('_')
<

fold#cleanest_fold_text()
                just include the text on the line except fold markers

                Examples: >
                        set foldtext=fold#cleanest_fold_text()

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOLD EXPRESSION~

Lines that are at the same indented level are folded along with the first line
above them one indent level up.

fold#get_clean_fold_expr({lnum})
                like indent folding but also include first line that is one
                indent level lower

                Examples: >
                        set foldmethod=expr
                        set foldexpr=fold#get_clean_fold_expr(v:lnum)


==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                       *clean-fold-configuration*

Example an alternate configuration:~

nmap <Tab><Tab> <Plug>(fold-open)
nmap <S-Tab><S-Tab> <Plug>(fold-close)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

g:clean_fold_default_mapping~

If unset disables the default mappings.
