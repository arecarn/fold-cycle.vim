DESCRIPTION                                          *clean-fold-description*

This plugin has a few purposes, perhaps most interestingly, the ability to
cycle open and close folds and nested folds under the cursor or type of
'visibility cycling' similar to Emcas org-mode. Additionally this plugin provides
alternatives to the default foldtext, that clean up the appearance of folds.
Finally this plugin provides a new fold expression that is an alternative to
Vims standard indent method of folding.

USAGE                                                     *clean-fold-usage*

MAPPINGS~

                                                *<CR>*
<CR>                    Cycle open folds starting at the top level fold.
                        Subsequent invocations will open folds nested one
                        level under the top level fold. When all folds are
                        open. All folds will be closed recursively.
                        Plug mapping: `<Plug>(fold-open)`

                                                *<BS>*
<BS>                    Cycle close folds starting at the lowest nested fold.
                        Subsequent invocations will close folds nested one
                        level above the lowest nested fold. When all folds are
                        closed the final fold will be opened recursively.
                        Plug mapping: `<Plug>(fold-open)`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOLD TEXT STYLE~

Alternatives to the default foldtext and a new foldmethod

fold#clean_fold_text({foldchar})
                Cleaner alternative to default fold text that includes the text
                on the line, then fills the rest of the fold line with
                {foldchar} and displays the number of folded lines on the
                middle side of the screen.

                Usage: (using '_' as the fill character) >
                        set foldtext=fold#clean_fold_text('_')
<

fold#cleanest_fold_text()
                Just includes the text on the line except fold markers

                Usage: >
                        set foldtext=fold#cleanest_fold_text()

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOLD EXPRESSION~

Lines that are at the same indented level are folded along with the first line
above them one indent level up. This fold expr was taken with basically no
modification from Steve Losh's Learn Vimscript the Hard way's section on
folding.

fold#get_clean_fold_expr({lnum})
                Like indent folding but also include first line that is one
                indent level lower

                Usage: >
                        set foldmethod=expr
                        set foldexpr=fold#get_clean_fold_expr(v:lnum)
<

                In the example below there would be two folds (shiftwidth=4)

                Example:
                >
                        start of fold 1
                            part of fold 1
                            end of fold 1
                        start of fold 2
                            part of fold 2
                            end of fold 2
<

CONFIGURATION                                       *clean-fold-configuration*

Example an alternate configuration:~

nmap <Tab><Tab> <Plug>(fold-open)
nmap <S-Tab><S-Tab> <Plug>(fold-close)
