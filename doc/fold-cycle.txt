DESCRIPTION                                          *fold-cycle-description*

This plugin has a few purposes, perhaps most interestingly, the ability to
cycle open and close folds and nested folds under the cursor or type of
'visibility cycling' similar to Emacs org-mode.

MAPPINGS~

                                                *<CR>*
<CR>                    Cycle open folds starting at the top level fold.
                        Subsequent invocations will open folds nested one
                        level under the top level fold. When all folds are
                        open. All folds will be closed recursively.
                        Plug mapping: `<Plug>(fold-open)`

                                                *<BS>*
<BS>                    Cycle close folds starting at the lowest nested fold.
                        Subsequent invocations will close folds nested one
                        level above the lowest nested fold. When all folds are
                        closed the final fold will be opened recursively.
                        Plug mapping: `<Plug>(fold-open)`

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                       *fold-cycle-configuration*

Example an alternate configuration:~

nmap <Tab><Tab> <Plug>(fold-open)
nmap <S-Tab><S-Tab> <Plug>(fold-close)
