DESCRIPTION                                          *fold-cycle-description*

This plugin provides the ability to cycle open and closed folds and their
nested folds. It could also be described as a type of visibility cycling
similar to Emacs org-mode.

USAGE                                                      *fold-cycle-usage*


<CR>                    Cycle open folds starting at the top level fold.
                        Subsequent invocations will open folds nested one
                        level under the top level fold. When all folds are
                        open, the next invocation will close the top level
                        fold recursively.

                        This mapping overrides the default behavior of *<CR>*

                        Plug mapping: `<Plug>(fold-cycle-open)`


<BS>                    Cycle close folds starting at the lowest nested fold.
                        Subsequent usess will close the next level of
                        nested folds. When all folds are closed the next
                        us will open the fold recursively.

                        This mapping overrides the default behavior of *<BS>*

                        Plug mapping: `<Plug>(fold-cycle-close)`

z<CR>                   Cycle open all folds globally starting with closed
                        folds with the lowest fold level. Subsequent
                        uss will open all folds with the next lowest
                        fold level. When all folds are open, the next
                        use will close all folds recursively.

                        This mapping overrides the default behavior of *z<CR>*

                        Plug mapping: `<Plug>(fold-cycle-open-global)`


z<BS>                   Cycle close all folds globally starting with open
                        folds with the highest fold level. Subsequent
                        uses will close folds with the next highest
                        fold level. When all folds are closed, the next
                        use will open all folds recursively.

                        Plug mapping: `<Plug>(fold-cycle-close-global)`

CONFIGURATION                                      *fold-cycle-configuration*

g:fold_cycle_default_mapping                   *g:fold_cycle_default_mapping*
                       If set to 0 disables the default mappings.
                       Defaults to 1.


Configuration Examples

                       Using just the "fold open" commands:
                       >
                       let g:fold_cycle_default_mapping = 0 "disable default mappings
                       nmap <CR> <Plug>(fold-cycle-open)
                       nmap <BS> <Plug>(fold-cycle-open-global)
<
                       or
                       >
                       let g:fold_cycle_default_mapping = 0 "disable default mappings
                       nmap <TAB><TAB> <Plug>(fold-cycle-open)
                       nmap <S-TAB><S-TAB> <Plug>(fold-cycle-open-global)
<

                       Alternative Key Mappings
                       >
                       let g:fold_cycle_default_mapping = 0 "disable default mappings
                       nmap z; <Plug>(fold-cycle-open)
                       nmap z, <Plug>(fold-cycle-close)
                       nmap z) <Plug>(fold-cycle-open-global)
                       nmap z( <Plug>(fold-cycle-close-global)

<
                       Override Defaults
                       >
                       let g:fold_cycle_default_mapping = 0 "disable default mappings
                       nmap zo <Plug>(fold-cycle-open)
